In many cases, software engineering is not a typical 9 to 5 job. It is fairly stressful as well. I enjoy programming, I dont fell stress so it will motivate me to the point that your code will eventually. I wrote what was meant to be a humorous post about the trials of the job in 2020. It is supposed to be a joke, but in some environments those points are too true. You can have some level of job security. In this economy, any level of job security is good. This does not mean that programmers always keep their jobs. We go through layoffs just like everyone else.There is good money in software engineering. You may not see large wads of cash to start, but over time your salary will grow. If you look at salary surveys for different locations, senior level engineers can make 3-4 lakhs or more per month.
